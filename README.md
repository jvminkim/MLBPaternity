# MLBPaternity
Hello!

This project was to see how players performed the game after being activated from the paternity list. The webscraper built can also be used to track performances after any other transaction. If you're interested in doing so, just switch the key tags in the script, search_pat and search_paternity.

If you're running the webscraper, you might run into issues where the website just doesn't run as fast or there might be an add that shows up. Fangraphs has more ads, but I've circumvented most of the issues around Fangraphs. If you get a cookie or another notification on either site and the code seems to not work, try adding a time.sleep(x) inside of the "main" functions, where x is the seconds it rests before executing, and click on any accept or deny cookies before the code runs.

The twitter_code has code on how my account will scrape the transactions list daily and tweet out who's activated from the paternity list! Please follow my twitter @MLBFathers.

Here's the article I wrote in accordance with this project!
